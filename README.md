## Overview
This repository is a part of my participation in the Major League Hacking (MLH) as a Hacker. The focus of this workshop is on machine learning classification, with an emphasis on various ML algorithms.

## Contents
1. **Lessons:**
   - There are a total of 3 lessons planned for this workshop.
   - Each lesson covers different aspects of machine learning classification.

2. **Current Progress:**
   - I am currently working on Lesson-1.
   - Lesson-1 is centered around K-Means Clustering under Unsupervised Learning.
   - Additionally, I am exploring and comparing it with Random Forest Regression under Supervised Learning.

3. **Code:**
   - All the code related to Lesson-1 can be found in the `lesson_1.ipynb` file.
   - The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the implementation, analysis, and comparisons.

## Future Updates
   - More lessons will be added to this repository as the workshop progresses.
   - Each lesson will delve into different machine learning concepts, algorithms, and applications.

## How to Use
   - Clone this repository to your local machine to access the code and materials.
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`lesson_1.ipynb`) to follow along with Lesson-1.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Happy hacking and learning!

**Note:** Make sure to check for updates, as more content will be added to enhance your machine learning classification skills.
